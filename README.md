# Algorithmic-Vase 

In summary, I used PyTorch to make the rough 3D model, then refined it using Fusion360. 3D modeling using TensorFlow often results in ‘dirty’ models, where the corners don’t match up, especially for more complex models. This is why Fusion360 is necessary to refine the model. Unfortunately, I lost all related files in a hard drive failure. There is a blog post though. 
These vases are still in use today and are quite mesmerizing.
